# Masters_Thesis_Code
This is the code for my masters thesis. There are two notebooks contained in this repository.

The first contains all data processing steps taken. This includes handling missing values, scaling and outlier detection. 

The second is for model training, hyper-paramter tuning, and model testing. 4 techniques were used namely logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost and Neural Nets.
